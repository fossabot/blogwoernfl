                For the last couple of years I have been working in an english speaking area using some tools like
                GCP, AWS, Kubernetes, Gitlab, Terraform or Ansible to deploy DevOps pipeline and setup/manage highly
                scalable resilient environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I am running my own business to help IT professional adopt Cloud and DevOps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Always looking for new challenges, I am happy to share my knowledge.
